R10.5 Events
Event objects are objects of the program that allow users to interact with the program
and include both sources and listeners to define events, when they occur, and what to do.

Event sources are the buttons and other components that generate a particular event.
Event source calls the appropriate methods of attached event listeners.

Event listeners are objects that indicate which events must occur.
They are objects that are instance of classes, and the methods of
event listener classes contain instructions that you want executed when events occur.


R10.6 actionPerformed
The actionPerformed method is called by the user and the JVM when the event occurs,
at which point the Java event handling library calls the listener's actionPerformed method.
In terms of timing, the call to actionPerformed occurs when the event is triggered and
the listener object is able to detect it.


R10.11 Inner class and event-listeners
We use inner classes for event listeners to better organize our project code and to
access instance variables and methods of the surrounding class.
If Java did not have inner classes, we can still implement event listeners by
creating a regular class, declaring the listener object, and adding it to the event source.


R10.14 Object hierarchies
Methods declared in JTextArea: append and getLineCount
Methods that JTextArea inherits from JTextComponent: setText and setEditable
Methods that JTextArea inherits from JComponent: setMinimumSize and setToolTipText


R10.22 Graphic methods
You would edit lines 25 and 27 by replacing the colors in the setColor method as desired.
You can keep the coordinates the same, as well as the black color outlines above and below
the flag's middle white portion. Randomization can also be used to edit the green and red
colors of the Italian flag to anything else.


R11.2 Layout managers
The advantage of a layout manager over telling the container "place this component at
position (x, y)" is that the former can dynamically adjust its container layouts to fit
and reposition components within the allotted area.


R11.11 ButtonGroup
You need a button group object for radio buttons but not for check boxes because
the radio buttons needs to find out whether one is turned on so others can be turned off.
Check boxes, on the other hand, do not exclude each other so does not require button group.


R11.19 Types of Events
ActionEvent is detected by the ActionListener and can detect component-specific actions
such as buttons, check boxes, etc. Because only one event of such type can happen at any time,
only one ActionEvent can be processed at any time. MouseEvent is detected by the MouseListener
and can detect clicks, moves, releases and other mouse actions. Because multiple mouse actions
can occur simultaneously (click and drag), MouseEvent can register more than one event at a time.
