R9.2 superclass and subclass
Because the store we are dealing with is a small appliance store, we can expect the inventory
to be mostly small appliances. Because they are the same type of items, the behavior of these items
will share too much similarity to warrant any subclass construction.
No uniquely helpful attributes can be declared for each item


R9.4 SavingsAccount
The SavingsAccount subclass inherits the deposit() and getBalance() methods,
while overriding the withdraw() and monthEnd() methods. It adds a new setInterestRate() method.

R9.10 Casting
Casting *(int) x* will risk a loss in precision from one value to another
(potentially changing the underlying primitive value entirely).
Casting *(BankAccount) x* will not change the value, but may be invalid and
throw a class cast exception.
