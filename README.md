## Instructions

Navigate to '''./final_game_mvc/controller/''' and build+run '''Game.java'''.

## Gameplay

Move your ship with arrow keys, being careful of the physics in space.

There are 3 enemies to avoid: asteroids, tiny mines, and UFOs.

The asteroids will break up into successively-smaller pieces once blasted, spraying outwards. Be careful!

The tiny mines and UFOs will lock on and home into your spaceship, so kill them quickly before they get too close. Mines are slower but smaller.

To help the player, powerups will spawn and float randomly throughout the game.

The flickering green powerup give you a new life, while the flickering blue object gives you a new round of shockwave missile.

The shockwave missiles, launched with 'A' key, is powerful - it radiates on impact or at max distance a growing shock zone that kills all enemies in its wake.

The gold shell object upgrades your ship with more bullets, fired in a larger radial span.

The transparent blue orb regenerates your shield for a moderate duration.

Controls are displayed at the title screen of the game. Press 'M' key to play/stop music once the game has started.
